				<p class="mx-5">The main idea is to make the best estimate of your opponent's hand using the available information: opponent's regions and champions, weighted popularity of different decks in the current meta, and current game state (opponent's mana, round #, etc.). See the detailed explanation of the approach below:</p>

					For any selected combination of Champions, there is usually more than one version of a deck that your opponent might be playing and we need to account for all of them. You can see the number of matched decks on the top left corner of the window after selecting Champions. <br><br> Data about potential decks is not perfect for now but still very useful: deck list is gathered from videos (streamers and influencers), and LoR stats websites (Mobalytics, LoR Guardian, and others). Deck list accuracy is expected to increase a lot once Riot API adds match history data.<br><br> All stats are weighted based on each deck's popularity to provide the most likely probabilities.

				<div class="card-body text-left">
					It's important to calculate mulligan and round draw probabilities separately and then add up probabilities (many online calculators don't do this). It doesn't matter in cases when there was no replacement during mulligan but impacts probabilities if at least one card was replaced. <br><br>For example if 4 cards were replaced for round 1, at first we need to calculate a probability of our target outcome given 8 cards were drawn out of 40 and then add the probability of our target outcome given 1 card was drawn out of 36 (as cards are shuffled back after mulligan). Note that in some cases it is not the same as the probability of our target outcome given 9 cards were drawn out of 40.

					These ranges indicate the chance of having drawn the exact number of copies since the start of the game. For example, if your opponent already played one of two copies of Zed and you want to know the chance of playing another one, you should look up 'Probability 2 Drawn' value. Details on calculations. <br><br> Probability 0 Drawn: Probability of 0 drawn during mulligan * probability of 0 drawn in rounds. <br><br>Probability of at least one copy: 1 - Probability of 0 Drawn <br><br>Probability 1 Drawn: (Probability of 1 drawn during mulligan * probability of 0 drawn in rounds) + (Probability of 0 drawn during mulligan * probability of 1 drawn in rounds) <br><br>Probability 2 Drawn: (Probability of 2 drawn during mulligan * probability of 0 drawn in rounds) + (Probability of 0 drawn during mulligan * probability of 2 drawn in rounds) + (Probability of 1 drawn during mulligan * probability of 1 drawn in rounds) <br><br> Probability 3 Drawn: it was getting a bit complicated here so I just use deck inclusion rate - (max probability 0 drawn + min probability 1 draw + min probability 2 drawn) and vice versa for the upper range.
